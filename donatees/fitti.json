Building [Bitcoin on Twitch](https://github.com/Fittiboy/bitcoin-on-twitch) (and the [LNbits extension](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/master/lnbits/extensions/streamalerts)), bringing Bitcoin to streamers. Also working on more, like [paywalled Discord invites](https://fitti.io/discord) and [inboxes](https://fitti.io/dm). I also do a lot of work behind the scenes to educate and onboard new users.",
